# Product roadmap and progress

> **Mission:** Build a practical, free and open-source MCP/AI-agent security testing product that helps developers find contract, authorization and unsafe tool-execution mistakes **before deployment**. All future connections to external systems must be explicitly authorized, bounded and isolated. Passing tests is not a security certification.
>
> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-23 · **Current main:** `v0.0.10-rc.1` · **Next task:** [M3-01: Fixed local stdio mock adapter](../../issues/6)

This roadmap is the **source of truth for priorities and acceptance criteria**. GitHub Issues track the individual tasks; merged PRs and GitHub Actions runs are the evidence. Version names and milestone scope can change when requirements are better understood. Do not read future milestones as implemented features.

## Where we stand

| Indicator | Verified state | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public independently maintained source | **Done**; MIT license | [LICENSE](LICENSE) |
| First baseline | **v0.0.9**; 243 synthetic tests | [Original CI](../../actions/runs/39852303226) — 4/4 jobs passed |
| Latest candidate in `main` | **v0.0.10-rc.1**; 311 synthetic tests | [PR #15](../../pull/15) and [post-merge CI](../../actions/runs/39917058997) — 4/4 jobs, 311/311 tests each |
| Supported automated test matrix | **Windows + Ubuntu, Node.js 20 + 22** | [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) |
| Security boundary model | **DONE**; offline synthetic threat model and future adapter checklist | [Threat model](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md), [PR #9](../../pull/9) |
| Tracked near-term roadmap work | **4/6 issues complete** | [Open issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) |
| Real external MCP-server interoperability/security testing | **Not yet implemented** | See **M4**; no live-scanner claim |
| Deployment, hosted service, npm release, certification | **Not yet delivered** | Future milestones |

The numbers above measure **engineering acceptance only**, not commercial traction, protocol certification or proven effectiveness against real attacks.

## Milestone overview

| Milestone | Focus | Status | Tracking | Exit gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **M0 — Foundation** | MIT public source, offline harness, version-retry protection, automated CI | **DONE** | [PR #1](../../pull/1); [post-merge CI](../../actions/runs/39910034366) | 4/4 OS/runtime jobs green, scoped public source |
| **M1 — Trustworthy security core** | Threat model, retry state-machine hardening, independent negative controls | **DONE — 3/3** | [#2](../../issues/2), [#3](../../issues/3), [#4](../../issues/4) | Deterministic deny cases, bounded/report-safe failures, CI 4/4 |
| **M2 — Developer experience** | Machine-readable reports, usable quickstart and CI integration | **IN PROGRESS — 1/2** | [#5](../../issues/5), [#7](../../issues/7) | External developer can run a fictional PASS and expected FAIL and understand the results |
| **M3 — Safe adapter foundation** | Explicitly bounded local, fixed stdio MCP mock adapter | **QUEUED — 0/1** | [#6](../../issues/6) | Cross-platform mock interoperability without arbitrary commands, credentials or external network |
| **M4 — Authorized integration preview** | Opt-in interoperability against user-owned, isolated staging fixtures/targets | **FUTURE** | Issues to be written after M1–M3 review | Allowlist + explicit target authorization + strict default deny; no production probes |
| **M5 — Useful OSS beta** | Packaging, contribution loop, documented examples and community feedback | **FUTURE** | Issues to be scoped | Repeatable installation/use, versioned releases, triaged external feedback |
| **M6 — Product maturity / 1.0 candidate** | Stable contracts, threat-model upkeep, independent review and maintainability | **FUTURE** | Issues to be scoped | Stable versioned public API/CLI, negative-control coverage, externally reviewed limits and maintenance policy |

We will not claim a release is production-ready merely because a synthetic test suite passes.

## Ordered near-term backlog

These are actual GitHub Issues, not aspirational checkmarks. **Close each only when its Definition of Done is evidenced by a merged PR and verified CI.**

1. **DONE — [M1-01 · Threat model and scope boundaries (#2)](../../issues/2)** — documented trust boundaries and future adapter gates in [THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md); [merged PR #9](../../pull/9) and [post-merge CI](../../actions/runs/39912395585) verified 4/4.
2. **DONE — [M1-02 · Fail-closed retry-state transitions (#3)](../../issues/3)** — added nine regression tests and strict fail-closed retry checks; [merged PR #11](../../pull/11) and [post-merge CI](../../actions/runs/39913669267) verified 4/4.
3. **DONE — [M1-03 · Independent negative-control corpus (#4)](../../issues/4)** — 18 golden mutations and 25 security regressions in [NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md](docs/NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md); [merged PR #13](../../pull/13) and [main CI](../../actions/runs/39915007747) verified 4/4.
4. **DONE — [M2-01 · Versioned machine-readable CLI reports (#5)](../../issues/5)** — additive schema v1, 23 regression tests, safe error summaries and [CLI report contract](docs/CLI_REPORTS.md); [merged PR #15](../../pull/15) and [post-merge CI](../../actions/runs/39917058997) verified 4/4.
5. **P1 — [M3-01 · Fixed local stdio mock adapter (#6)](../../issues/6)** — reproducible MCP-shaped transport behavior, bounded execution and explicit limitations. **NEXT**.
6. **P1 — [M2-02 · Developer tutorial and CI recipe (#7)](../../issues/7)** — clean-clone quickstart and fictional positive/negative examples.

**Dependencies:** M1-01 informs the security invariants in M1-02 and M1-03; M2-01 and M3-01 support the complete developer example in M2-02. We may work on independent pieces in parallel, but must still satisfy those acceptance gates.

## What a complete product should deliver

- **Pre-deployment security checks:** developers select reproducible checks for permissions, cross-resource boundaries, replay, tool calls, protocol negotiation and failure handling.
- **Safe target configuration:** start with entirely fictional fixtures, then fixed local mocks. Only later consider explicit opt-in, user-owned staging servers, never arbitrary external scanning by default.
- **Actionable results:** machine-readable CI artifacts and a human-friendly explanation of the violated invariant, without echoing confidential data.
- **Repeatability:** a security regression can be represented by a sanitized fixture and rerun locally and in CI on supported platforms.
- **Accessible OSS workflow:** good documentation, no compulsory paid APIs, clear extension interfaces and reviewable contributions.

## Standard delivery and progress policy

1. Pick the highest-priority unblocked Issue; mark it as **in progress** in its discussion or PR link. Do not invent progress percentages.
2. Implement only the scoped change in a fresh feature branch; use synthetic data, no secrets and no unrelated proprietary source.
3. Add a positive example and a negative control; validate changed code against its documented requirements.
4. Open a PR referencing the Issue, review the exact diff and run **four** required jobs: Ubuntu/Windows × Node.js 20/22.
5. Merge only after all four jobs pass; verify the post-merge `main` CI before claiming delivery. Stop on unexpected results.
6. Close the linked Issue with PR and CI evidence, then update **this progress table**, version/release notes if applicable, and choose the next Issue.

**Progress report format:** `DONE / IN PROGRESS / BLOCKED / NEXT`, relevant GitHub links, verified test count and risks. A pending item is not a completed milestone.

## Release gates and boundaries

- A `-rc` package is a **release candidate**, not a stable or independently security-audited product.
- Preserve genuine public MIT provenance. Never import commercial/private Stable Bridge code, history, secrets, internal logs or credentials.
- Default execution is offline, synthetic and deterministic. No paid API calls or live-system scanning without separately approved design and authorization.
- Process separation does **not** equal an OS sandbox; avoid that security claim until independently demonstrated.
- Protocol-shaped tests are not a formal guarantee of conformance to all versions of MCP or JSON-RPC.
- External contributions or claims about real users must be supported by evidence.
- Any major architectural pivot, networked adapter, collection of telemetry, deployment or paid service requires explicit owner review.

## Decisions pending future milestones

Real integration adapter transport/API design, target authorization UX, trust model for untrusted third-party MCP servers, distribution channel, support policy and independent audit scope are intentionally left open until M1–M3 evidence exists. This keeps the public product extensible without pretending unfinished parts are already secure.
